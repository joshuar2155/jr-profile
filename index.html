                <p class="">My name is Joshua Rae. I am a graduate from the Penn LPS Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Over the length of our course we learned many critical skills, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, mySQL, Web APIs, MERN, and many others. As part of the curriculum, we were tasked with creating three websites as the major projects of the course. They were all fun and exciting, and included a lot of patience, teamwork, and creativity. Below are my three projects I helped build with my team members. I'm very proud of each, and considering I did a great deal of the front end UI and look of the sites, I believe it is a strong testament to what I learned. As I hope to break into the frontend development hemisphere, I hope these sites will showcase what I'm capable of. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Vapor:</h2>
            <p class="lead">Vapor was a project to mimic the video game marketplace with our own style. Most people are familiar with Steam, so our application Vapor was designed to be a rival video game marketplace that could offer customers more incentives than the competition. We had marketing concepts to offer cloud storage, cryptocurrency, NFTs, and more. I'm very proud of this project and it had great potential for future development.</p>

            <p class="lead">Moody Gamer was designed to be a fun decision helper. If you ever aren't sure what video game to play, this site helps you choose what genre you should check out based on your Zodiac sign. Based on your choices to the prompts, it devises what genre is most suitable for your sign and mood. I really liked working on this project because it was our first sampling of using Web APIs and was a great learning experience.  </p>

            <p class="lead">Arthub was a project to create a webspace solely for artists. This site allowed you to post your artwork, set prices, connect with other users, and essentially be an online marketplace for aspiring artists. Although the site was presented with psuedo users and left clear afterward, our project team was excited to continue working on the site to make it fully functional. I liked this project because similar to my other works, I was given a strong role in designing the look of the site.   </p>
